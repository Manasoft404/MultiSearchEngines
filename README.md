# MultiSearchEngines
Integrated search for multiple search engines is as simple as its said. The idea is that you use one search engine, or more like a search site, which will find you your results based on other search engines that do the actual retrieving of the data. One site will do the search for your query for a number of search engines, that you would have otherwise had to do individually one site at a time.
